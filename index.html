        <p class="para 1">These days, we store our photos, stream our movies, and even run our businesses in the cloud. And more and more often, whether we realize it or not, it’s also where we’re ordering our food.Introducing cloud kitchens, commercial facilities purpose-built to produce food specifically for delivery. These commissary kitchens are sometimes also known as ghost kitchens, shared kitchens, or virtual kitchens with the delivery-only food brands operating within them called virtual restaurants. Maybe you’re thinking: “this is nothing new” and in a way, you are right. Chinese restaurants have been making the most of delivery for decades. And the pizza industry has practically built its business around optimizing for delivery. But moving to a delivery-only model has been made possible recently by advances in technology and changes in consumer habits. It offers certain advantages over offering delivery from a traditional brick-and-mortar restaurant.Before we get into how a cloud kitchen differs from a normal restaurant offering delivery, let’s take a look at where The Food Corridor fits in. </p>
        <p class="para"></p>
        <p class="para">In fact, through our sister app, The Kitchen Door, we’ve facilitated thousands of new connections between food entrepreneurs looking for a commercial kitchen to expand their business and existing commercial kitchens looking to rent out unused space. And we’re seeing increased interest on both sides. We’ve also noticed that food entrepreneurs are increasingly seeking commercial kitchen space to launch their own virtual restaurant concepts and shared kitchens in our network are responding to the demand by offering additional services to maximize the efficiency and success of virtual restaurant tenants.</p>
        <p class="para">Our mission is to nurture this community and continue to connect supply with demand while also helping shared kitchens run their businesses more efficiently by providing them with software purpose-built for them. This article is a good starting point to learn the cloud kitchen basics. First, we’ll take a look at how a cloud kitchen actually works. Then, we will look at the most common delivery-only business models, followed by the pros and cons of running a cloud kitchen. </p>
        <p class="para">Finally, we’ll explore the industry trends surrounding shared kitchens and what the future looks like for this new era of food delivery, before pointing out further resources for those looking to set up their own cloud kitchen business.</p>
